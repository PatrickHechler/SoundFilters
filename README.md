# SoundFilters
Sound Filters is a small minecraft mod that adds reverb to caves and mutes sounds when you're underwater or when the sound source is behind a wall.

If you want to contribute to Sound Filters (for instance update it to a new version of MC, or fix a bug), send up a PR and I'll review it as soon as I can. =)
